The National Leadership Centre Award for Public Service recognises the success of leaders and organisations who are working across systems to tackle public service challenges in a complex environment. 

The Award will be won by a cross-sector team who demonstrate excellence across the following equally-weighted criteria:

* systems leadership: leading across organisations to deliver demonstrable improvements in outcomes for citizens 
* ethical leadership: leading in an inclusive way that reflects the diversity of our citizens
* inspiring and relatable: leading with pride and passion that engages others 

The nomination must relate to a project or team with representation from across three public service organisations that started on or after the 1 January 2018.

## How to nominate

Nominations should be no longer than two pages, and cover the following headings:

* description of the project and the user need being met
* team composition
* evidence of successful outcomes
* barriers encountered
* lessons learned
* lead contact for the project who can be contacted for further information if needed

The nomination must also include a short video (maximum of 3 minutes) of a member of the public who benefitted from the cross-sector work of the project or team. Videography skills are not a barrier to entry, a short clip from a phone will suffice!

Your nomination must be signed off by the Chief Executives (or equivalent) of the organisations represented in the nominated project.

Nominations should be sent to NLC@CabinetOffice.gov.uk

The deadline for nomination is Friday 3 January 2020. 

Nominations will be shortlisted and a winner will be decided by [the NLC Advisory Board](about/board/).

The winner will be announced at the National Leadership Forum in central London on Wednesday 29 January, to which shortlisted nominees will be invited.
