We are working with leaders, academics and practitioners to bring the best of the available evidence together in one place. We are building a deeper understanding of the complex links between leadership, productivity and outcomes in public services. 

We believe that the best way we can support these leaders is to increase their ability to work as a system. To do this successfully, we are:

* developing a data-driven picture of public sector leadership
* running place-based pilots across the country
* commissioning original, rigorous research

We are also monitoring and evaluating the National Leadership Centre’s (NLC) portfolio of work in partnership with an independent supplier. It is so important that we test, learn and adapt what we do. 

## Public service leadership for the 21st Century

We do not want to create a new leadership model to ‘export’ to other organisations. We also do not want to create new boxes for leaders to tick. We are developing an approach to leadership that will underpin the work of the NLC, which aims to encourage a more collaborative way of working across the whole public service system.

To do this, we will take a highly iterative approach and seek out the best evidence about what works, listening carefully to the senior leaders we work with. We will learn
from others, developing and collecting new evidence to further this field of knowledge.

We have identified five leadership qualities that appear most relevant to the NLC’s aims and audience. These initial qualities are: adaptive, connected, questioning, purposeful and ethical.

### Adaptive
Adaptive leaders are able to change proactively and constantly learn in a complex, uncertain and volatile world.

### Connected
Connected leaders are empathic, collaborative thinkers who consistently work across organisational boundaries to build strategic relationships across the public service.

### Questioning
Questioning leaders are open minded and seek to understand the views and experiences of others. 

### Purposeful
Purposeful leaders display absolute clarity about their mission and purpose, and they are able to see beyond the problems and pressures of the present.

### Ethical
Ethical leaders consistently behave in ways that create trust, and they take a long-term, sustainable approach to fulfilling the organisation’s public service mission.

By helping leaders to enhance these qualities, we believe we can help them to deepen their impact on the organisations they run, the services they lead, and – ultimately – the lives of citizens.
