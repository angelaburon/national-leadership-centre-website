* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* read most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
* We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
