We are excited about the work we are doing in the National Leadership Centre. We have four values that talk about how we want to deliver exceptional work and who we want to be as a team.

## Human
We enhance and develop relationships, being sensitive and considerate to the whole person who is coming to work and their external commitments. 

## Expert
We have a voracious appetite for new evidence and rigorously test new cutting-edge research, to ensure we have a data-led approach to strategy and delivery.

## Bold
We have the confidence to push boundaries with new approaches and innovative ways of thinking.

## Open
We encapsulate the transparent and collaborative approach we are trying to embed in the public sector by listening to others and sharing our knowledge, ideas and experiences.
