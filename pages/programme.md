The most difficult challenges faced by our public services are complex and cross-cutting. People in charge of organisations are trying to achieve strategic outcomes that they can only partly influence, and being accountable for the whole organisation means overseeing a wider range of expertise. 

To help people make the move into these roles, we will deliver a flagship development programme.

Our delegates will have just taken on, or will be about to take on, the most senior and challenging roles across public service. They will be the public face of their organisation, expected to operate with senior leaders from other sectors and deliver services to thousands or even millions of people each year. 

We are working closely with and building on the great work in existing service academies (such as the Defence Academy and the Civil Service Leadership Academy). It’s not a replacement or competitor for those programmes. We will bring people together across the public sector to learn together.

In advance of the programme delegates will gain a world-leading, detailed understanding of their leadership style, strengths, weaknesses and the personal traits which help them further their self awareness and stand out from the crowd.

The diagnostic has been developed by one of the world’s leading consultancies on leadership insight to adapt their cutting-edge work on private sector CEO succession to suit the challenges and environment of public sector leaders. 

The programme will stretch over a year and consist of:

* residential modules - covering 'systems leadership'; 'putting it into practice'; and 'looking to the future of systems leadership'
* exploring the qualities of adaptive, connected, questioning, purposeful and ethical leadership
experiential and on-the-job learning
* peer to peer visits to gain a better understanding and unique insight into how these organisations are run
access to a coach, whether your focus is on personal development or the development of your top team

We will share more details of the programme, its timing, and information about future cohorts in the coming months.
