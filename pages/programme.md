The most difficult challenges faced by our public services are complex and cross-cutting. People in charge of organisations are trying to achieve strategic outcomes that they can only partly influence. And being accountable for the whole organisation means overseeing a wider range of expertise. 

To help people make the move into these roles, we are delivering a flagship leadership programme, the first of its kind in bringing together top leaders from across the country’s entire public sector system.

The programme is designed for newly appointed or aspiring Chief Executive Officer level leaders, as they take on the most senior and challenging roles across public service. 

The programme will take place over a year and consist of:

* a pre-programme diagnostic of each delegate’s leadership style, strengths, and weaknesses
* residential modules covering 'systems leadership', 'putting it into practice', and 'looking to the future of systems leadership'
* exploring the qualities of [adaptive, connected, questioning, purposeful and ethical leadership](/research)
* experiential and on-the-job learning
* peer-to-peer visits to gain a better understanding and unique insight into how different organisations are run
* access to a coach, whether the focus is on personal development or the development of a top team
