## Who can attend

Participants who are invited to take part in the NLC Programme will have just taken on, or will be about to take on, the most senior roles across public service.

They will be making a transition from being part of a senior leadership team, to being the person with principal executive responsibility within the organisation.

As the public face of their organisation, they are expected to operate with senior leaders from other sectors and deliver services to thousands or even millions of people each year.
