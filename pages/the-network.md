User research shows that leaders tend to make links with other leaders in their own sectors, and often within their local areas, but rarely with public service leaders outside of those criteria. The Connect Network connects people across these boundaries.

Research shows that the higher ranking a leader becomes   the more potential there is for that person to become exposed and isolated in their role. Supporting leaders to build cross-sector connections gives them the opportunity to share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-agency response.

### Become a part of the Connect Network for Senior Leaders 
The Connect Network for Senior Leaders is open to all senior leaders across the public sector.

### Events across the country
The NLC brings leaders together through national, regional and small group events. This allows peers to make time, outside formal governance or partnership structures, to work together to address the most complex and pressing problems that they face.

### International peers
The public service challenges in this country are mirrored in countries throughout the world. Our priorities may have been successfully addressed abroad, and our leaders will have experience to share internationally as well.

This is why the National Leadership Centre, in partnership with the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/), will host an international summit for some of the worldâ€™s most senior public service leaders in 2020. This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice.
