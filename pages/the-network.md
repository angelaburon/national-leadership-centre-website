## The National Leadership Centre is creating a network that connects people from across every sector and region. This will include:

Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the National Health Service, including NHS Trusts, Ambulance Trusts, and Clinical Commissioning Groups.
University Vice-Chancellors
Heads of large Further Education Colleges and Academy Chains
Local Authority CEOs
Police Chief Constables
Fire Chiefs
Civil Service Permanent Secretaries and Director Generals
Three star Military officers
CEOs of large Housing Associations
CEOs of large Arms Length Bodies and Regional Transport Authorities

User research shows that leaders tend to make links within their own sectors, and often within their local areas, but this rarely happens outside those structures. This new network connects people across these boundaries.

Leading is a difficult job. At the top of organisations, people more exposed and isolated. Helping leaders build connections will help them share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-agency response.

### Test our network directory
The National Leadership Centre is testing ways to help senior leaders find each other and get in contact with each other, starting with a directory for network members only.

### Events across the country
The NLC will bring leaders together through national, regional and small group events. This will allow peers to make time, outside formal governance or partnership structures, to work together to address the problems that are most pressing.

At our event in January, we will be presenting the first NLC Award for Public Services.

### Connecting on a digital service
The NLC will create a private area of our website for the network. In this section, they’ll be able to find contact details for each other, start a conversation, and access cutting edge research, resources, and event information.

### International peers
The public service challenges in this country are mirrored in countries throughout the world. Our priorities may have been successfully addressed abroad, and our leaders will have experience to share internationally as well.

This is why the National Leadership Centre, in partnership with the British Council, will host an international summit for some of the world’s most senior public service leaders in 2020. This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice.
