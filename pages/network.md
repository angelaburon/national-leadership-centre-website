We are creating a network that connects people from across every sector and region. This will include:

* Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the National Health Service, including Ambulance Trusts
* University Vice-Chancellors
* Heads of large Further Education Colleges and Academy Chains
* Local Authority CEOs
* Police Chief Constables
* Fire Chiefs
* Civil Service Permanent Secretaries and Director Generals
* Three star Military officers
* CEOs of large Housing Associations

Our research tells us that leaders tend to make links within their own sectors, and sometimes within their local areas, but this rarely happens outside those structures. Our network connects people across these boundaries.

Leading is a difficult job. At the top of organisations, you're more exposed and isolated. Helping leaders build connections will help them share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-agency response.

## Test our network directory

We're testing ways to help senior leaders find each other and get in contact with each other.

## Events across the country

We will bring leaders together through national, regional and small group events. This will allow peers to make time, outside formal governance or partnership structures, to work together to address the problems that are most pressing.

## International peers

The challenges we are facing in this country are mirrored in countries throughout the world. Our priorities may have been successfully addressed abroad, and we will have experience to share internationally as well. 

This is why the National Leadership Centre will host an international summit for some of the worldâ€™s most senior public service leaders in 2020. This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice.
