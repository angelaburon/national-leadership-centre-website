Public sector leaders make a direct, lasting and profound impact on citizensâ€™ lives. Public service can be immensely fulfilling, but it is not always easy. Leaders tell us that despite their best efforts, they sometimes find themselves frustrated by the level of impact they can achieve.

<p class="gradient-text">
At the National Leadership Centre, we want to help people overcome these constraints to create transformational change across the system.

## Leadership programme
Our flagship leadership programme brings together 100 of the most senior people across the public sector each year.

## Network of peers
Through national and local events and a new digital service, we are connecting the country's leaders across every sector and region, nationally and internationally. 

## Research and evaluation
The National Leadership Centre is becoming a global hub of leadership data, high quality research and lessons learned.
