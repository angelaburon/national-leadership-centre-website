Public sector leaders have a direct, lasting and profound impact on citizensâ€™ lives. Public service can be immensely fulfilling, but it is not always easy. Leaders tell us that despite their best efforts, they sometimes find themselves frustrated by the level of impact they have.

<p class="gradient-text">
At the National Leadership Centre, we want to help leaders overcome these constraints to create transformational change across the system.

## Leadership development programme
Our flagship leadership programme is bringing together 100 of the most senior public sector leaders each year.

## Network of peers
Through national and local events and a new digital service, we are connecting the country's leaders across every sector and region. 

## Research 
The National Leadership Centre is a global hub of leadership data, high quality research and lessons learned.
