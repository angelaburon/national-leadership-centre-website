The National Leadership Centre was created by the Government in 2018 to support cross sector leadership, facilitating and supporting people to collaborate on the toughest challenges the country faces.

The scale and complexity of demands on our public services continue to grow. Investing in leadership is an important part of increasing productivity and supporting people to overcome a sense of isolation that often comes with becoming the most senior person of a public sector organisation.
