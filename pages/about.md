The National Leadership Centreâ€™s core mission is ultimately to improve efficiency and productivity in the public sector and see more effective service models delivered.

To make this happen, we have three strategic objectives:

<ol class="big-numbered-list">
<li>Deliver a <a href="/programme">flagship leadership programme</a> for around 100 senior public service leaders each year</li>

<li>Deliver a national and regional programme of events, and create a digital platform, to enable <a href="/network">a thriving network</a> of over 1,500 public sector leaders</li>

<li>Lead <a href="/research">high quality research</a> to develop a better understanding of the relationships between public service leadership, and productivity</li>
</ol>
