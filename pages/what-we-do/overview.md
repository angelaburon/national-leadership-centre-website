The National Leadership Centre was launched by the Chancellor in 2018 as a three year pilot, following the recommendations of the Public Services Leadership Taskforce. The Taskforce was established in 2017 to advise on the scope for a new body to support public service leaders.

### The Taskforce found that the scale and complexity of demands on our public services continue to grow. Modern society is becoming more diverse in its needs; technology is evolving at an accelerating rate; and the UK is striving for greater productivity within an increasingly complex world.

Although the Taskforce was clear that public service leadership is not a silver bullet for these challenges, they found that the weight of evidence suggests that bolstering public service leaders does make a difference. The Taskforce also found that many leaders are struggling with the strategic complexity of the services they lead, while experiencing a sense of isolation amid the challenges that come with becoming the most senior person of a public service organisation.

The Taskforce made a number of recommendations in their report and, in response, the government created the National Leadership Centre to support leaders of public services in England to improve the services they run.
