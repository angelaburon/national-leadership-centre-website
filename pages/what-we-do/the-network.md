## The National Leadership Centre has created the Connect Network for Senior Leaders. It connects people from across every sector and region. The public service leaders in the Network include:

<div class="container container--xs">

<ul class="dbl-margin">
	<li>Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the National Health Service, including NHS Trusts, Ambulance Trusts, and Clinical Commissioning Groups.</li>
	<li>University Vice-Chancellors</li>
	<li>Heads of large Further Education Colleges and Academy Chains</li>
	<li>Local Authority CEOs</li>
	<li>Police Chief Constables</li>
	<li>Fire Chiefs</li>
	<li>Civil Service Permanent Secretaries and Director Generals</li>
	<li>Three star Military officers</li>
	<li>CEOs of large Housing Associations</li>
	<li>CEOs of large Arms Length Bodies and Regional Transport Authorities</li>
</ul>

</div>

User research shows that leaders tend to make links with other leaders in their own sectors, and often within their local areas, but rarely with public service leaders outside of those criteria. The Connect Network connects people across these boundaries.

Research shows that the higher ranking a leader becomes the more potential there is for that person to become exposed and isolated in their role. Supporting leaders to build cross-sector connections gives them the opportunity to share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-agency response.

### **Become a part of the Connect Network for Senior Leaders**
The Connect Network for Senior Leaders is open to all senior leaders across the public sector.

[Request access to Connect Network of Senior Leaders](https://connect.nationalleadership.gov.uk/)

### Events across the country
The NLC brings leaders together through national, regional and small group events. This allows peers to make time, outside formal governance or partnership structures, to work together to address the most complex and pressing problems that they face.

### International peers
The public service challenges in this country are mirrored in countries throughout the world. Our priorities may have been successfully addressed abroad, and our leaders will have experience to share internationally as well.

This is why the National Leadership Centre, in partnership with the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/), will host an international summit for some of the world’s most senior public service leaders in 2020. This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice.
